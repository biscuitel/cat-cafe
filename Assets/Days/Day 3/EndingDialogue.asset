  - Why did you answer the phone? Aren't you supposed to be closing the cafe?
  - "It's good that you did pick up though, because you need to do something for
    me.\t\t"
  - "I can't make it into work tomorrow, so....\t"
  - You have to come in and do the opening shift.
  - I would let you leave early, but I'm preoccuppied the entire day, so you'll need
    to close up as well.
  - 'I trust this won''t be an issue for you. '
  - Who am I kidding...
  - 'Of course it won''t be an issue. I''m practically doing you a favour. '
  - It's a cat cafe! Who wouldn't want to work all day at a cat cafe?
  - But, besides that...
  - Hang on, where are you Bob? I don't see you on any of the security cams.
  - 'Are you in- '
  - Oh no...
  - '*click*'
