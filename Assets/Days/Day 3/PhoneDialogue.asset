  - 'BOB! '
  - Remember yesterday how I told you not to waste time?
  - I'm going to assume you heard what I said, and chose to ignore it.
  - You wanna know something? If I'd hired a more competent employee, I could've
    saved close to 10 dollars across the last two days.
  - 'This money has to be made up somehow, so I''m gettting rid of one of the cats
    tomorrow. '
  - That cat will become a stray like so many others, every day a fight for survival.
  - "You did this Bob. The next time you think about costing me money, take a long
    hard look into the eyes of our cats. They don't deserve what you're doing to
    them. \t"
  - Now, I need to get back to my game of poker. This is your last chance Bob. The
    clock is ticking!
