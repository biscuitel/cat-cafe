  - 'BOB! '
  - I know it's your first shift, but this shouldn't be too hard, even for you.
  - There isn't a whole lot to it. Close the cafe, clean up-
  - 'Hang on, why am I even telling you this? Everything you need to do is written
    on the task board. '
  - I should also mention that you don't need to feed the cats tonight. Money's tight,
    and cat food doesn't come cheap.
  - Oh, that reminds me! Your payslip won't come in till next month. You know how
    it is. The economy and all that.
  - 'Anyway, I need to get going. Just remember, I''ll know if you cut any corners.
    I always know. '
  - '*click*'
