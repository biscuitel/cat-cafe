  - 'BOB! '
  - I'd say you did a good job yesterday...
  - 'But you didn''t. '
  - I timed how long it took you to do your tasks, and let's just say I was less
    than impressed.
  - Fortunately, forgiveness is in my nature, so I'll let you off this time.
  - I also saw you popping a pill every 30 seconds. I won't make it my business to
    know the what or why, but if you feel like you're about to die, please leave
    the building beforehand.
  - Having an employee die on the premises is bad for business.
  - Oh, I almost forgot. I had to cancel that vet appointment tomorrow. Not that
    it's any of your concern, but if someone from the vet calls, just tell them they
    got the wrong number or something along those lines.
  - I don't see why I would have to pay some vet hundreds of dollars to tell me my
    cats are fine. They're my cats, I think I'd know.
  - 'Besides that, I have nothing else to say to you. '
  - '*click*'
