  - 'BOB! '
  - I'd say you did a good job yesterday...
  - 'But you didn''t. '
  - I timed how long it took you to do your tasks, and let's just say I was less
    than impressed.
  - Fortunately, forgiveness is in my nature, so I'll let you off this time.
  - I also saw you popping a pill every 30 seconds. I won't make it my business to
    know the what or why, but if you feel like you're about to die, please leave
    the building beforehand.
  - Having an employee die on the premises is bad for business.
  - Besides that, I have nothing else to add. Tasks are on the taskboard, and as
    always, time is money, so don't waste it.
  - '*click*'
